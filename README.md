# Lead-Score-case-study
Problem Statement: X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. There are many leads generated  through multiple Lead Generation System however, they need help in filtering the most  promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.  X Education wants to build a model wherein a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such  that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers  with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.  The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%
